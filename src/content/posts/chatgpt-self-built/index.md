**Congratulation!!!**

I build a AI-chatbot website by Open WebUI. Then I can use many LLM through this website, such as Claude, by calling APIs. This approach is very cost-effective.

However, the website is currently for myself only since there's no external demand.

Also, my cloud server only has 2GB RAM, and it has already reached its capacity. Thereofore I think I need to upgrade its later.

Overall, the experience has been great!
